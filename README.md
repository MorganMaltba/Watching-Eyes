### Eyes that follow your mouse!

**Description:** <br>
This project runs JavaScript to track mouse movements to make eyeball shaped div elements 'watch' the mouse.

To run, download all files into the same directory, and open the Watching Eyes.HTML file in your browser.

I plan to add blinks in the future.
